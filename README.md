# mpv-encoder
This is a fork of ekisu's [mpv-webm][mpv-webm] that adds several new settings, while removing unneeded or broken ones.

## Installation
Simply put the [script][build] into your `scripts` folder. By default, the script is activated with the `e` key.

## Usage
Follow the on-screen instructions. Video files will have audio/subs based on the current playback options (i.e. will be muted if no audio, won't have hardcoded subs if subs aren't visible).

## Building
Currently not supported, due to me being too lazy to update the files needed for it.
